# Sum of binary strings

Given two binary strings as an input, return their sum as a binary string.

## General theory and analysis

N/A

## Implementation notes

**Time complexity**: $O(max(N, M))$, where $N$ and $M$ are lengths of input strings

**Space complexity**: $O(max(N, M))$, because we use list for bits as auxiliary data structure
