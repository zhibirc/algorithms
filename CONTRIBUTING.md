# Welcome to Algorithms repository contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow.

1. To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md) file.

2. Choose what would you like to do (kind of activity):

- If you spot a problem with some algorithm, data structure, related documentation or service tools, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue.

- If you would like to make a contribution by adding new algorithm or data structure implementation, it will be much appreciated. In this case, please, follow these simple steps:
  - Determine the nature of your implementation and create directory (or directory tree) in appropriate place.
  - Give it a name which is descriptive and concise at the same time. Don't use verbs *find*, *check*, etc. if possible.
  - Add **main.<extension>** file with code and **readme.md** file with theoretical background for it to the directory created on previous step.
  - Add a ToC row with related information to appropriate section in [README](README.md#content) table.

3. For solving an issue or for any other contribution create a working branch and start with your changes!

4. Commit the changes once you are happy with them.

5. When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

Thanks! ❤️
