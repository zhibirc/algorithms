This is yet another place where various algorithms live.

The main focus was made on algorithms themselves, so you can find their implementations in different programming languages (mostly JavaScript, TypeScript, Python and Go). Each algorithm, if possible, is provided with the necessary description, indicating its asymptotic complexity and memory consumption.
