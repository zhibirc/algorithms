This is yet another place where various algorithms live.

The main focus was made on algorithms themselves, so you can find their implementations in different programming languages (mostly JavaScript, TypeScript, Python and Go). Each algorithm to the much extent possible is provided with the necessary description, including its asymptotic complexity and memory consumption.

You and/or your company could use it as a source for coding skills assessment during technical interview process, as an additional resource for self-preparation or just as a source for your own awesome algorithms collection.
