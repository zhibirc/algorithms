# Basics

__Dynamic Programming__ (DP) is a technique or method to solve some subclass of optimization and —Åombinatoric 
problems. Ability to solve the particular problem using DP based on the _optimal substructure_ property, i.e. its optimal solution can be constructed efficiently from optimal solutions of its subproblems.
